        <ce:para>Abstract: Regarding the issue of encrypted images in the channel attracting the attention of attackers and making them vulnerable to attacks. This paper proposes a high-quality visual image encryption algorithm utilizing the conservative chaotic system, two-dimensional compressive sensing, optimization local of binary patterns, and adaptive embedding method. Firstly, a conservative chaotic system with excellent performance and resistance to reconstruction attacks is proposed. Secondly, the pseudo-random sequences generated by the chaotic system dynamically generate measurement matrices, which are optimized before compressing the image. Then, during the encryption process, by utilizing the newly proposed composite DNA computing rules, chaotic sequences dynamically encode and compute image information, which enriches the coding criteria and improves the security of encryption algorithms. Finally, in the information embedding stage, the newly proposed OLBP algorithm can identify important textured and non-textured regions of the host image, prioritize embedding non-textured regions, and then embed textured regions, which can improve the amount of information embedding and reduce damage to the host image. Experimental simulation and analysis exhibit that the encryption algorithm has high security, strong robustness and high efficiency.

        <ce:section-title>Introduction</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>In pace with the speedy expansion of the Internet of Things and information technology, network security has become one of people's common concerns. As the most intuitive and commonly used communication method, the secure dissemination of information through images is crucial. However, illegal acquisition, tampering, and destruction of medical, military, corporate, and personal privacy images often occur, which will cause irreparable losses to society and the entire country. Image encryption is the efficacious measures of protecting image information. Due to the characteristics of images, traditional encryption algorithms are unsuitable for images. Therefore, exploring new image encryption technologies has become a research hotspot. Chaos has an indelible advantage in encryption algorithms due to its unique characteristics [1-4].</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Currently, multitudinous chaotic image cryptographic algorithms have been put forward, embodying DNA coding [5-7], Boolean networks or fractal matrix [8-9], compressive sensing [10-12], the model of the cellular automata [13-14], S-box [15-17], new mathematical models [18-19], and so on. Wang et al. [5] proposed a DNA encoding image cryptographic algorithm to achieve the purpose of encrypting images. Yet, Liu et al. [7] designed a dynamic DNA encoding and computation image encryption algorithm, whose dynamic behavior is controlled by sequences generated by chaotic systems. An asynchronous renewal Boolean network encryption algorithm using chaos was put forward by Gao et al. [8]. Xian et al. [9] raised a fractal sorting matrix using spiral transform and applied it to image encryption. To reduce the consumption of information in the channel, Nan et al. [10] and Liu et al. [12] put forward compressed sensing image encryption algorithms, which can achieve both encryption and compression of image information simultaneously. Li et al. [13] present a novel image cryptographic algorithm using cellular automata and composite chaos map. A visualized multiple image selection encryption algorithm using multilayer cellular automata saliency detection was proposed by Su et al. [14]. Zhu et al. [15] and Su et al. [16]. both advanced dynamic S-box image encryption algorithms, which typically require optimization of the S-box. Hence, these algorithms have high security but high time and resource consumption. To improve the safety of the algorithm, Erkan et al. [18] and Toktas et al. [19] have designed image cryptographic algorithms using new mathematical models. These algorithms have low efficiency. As mentioned, notwithstanding the advanced algorithms all reach the aim of image encryption, there are generally some things that could be improved. Firstly, dissipative chaos maps, which exist attractors in the phase space, are used, and destroyers can effectively attack them through reconstruction, which poses a security risk to the encryption algorithm. Secondly, these algorithms encrypt images into noise-like images, which will attract the attacker's attention and make them more vulnerable to attacks.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, many visual security image algorithms have been proposed successively, which can achieve dual protection of images in terms of content and visual aspects [20-21]. Yin et al. [22] drew an image reversible data hiding algorithm using bit-plane compression and pixel prediction, but this scheme has strict requirements for the size of hidden information and can only hide very small amounts of information. A cross-plane thumbnail preservation image encryption scheme was proposed by An et al. [23], and a high-quality visually color image cryptographic algorithm using block compressed sensing and a method of particle swarm optimization was proposed by Chai et al. [24]. These schemes are all aimed at color image encryption and have efficient advantages but lack universality. Huang et al. [25] and Zhu et al. [26] both process plain and carrier images in the frequency domain before embedding, but the embedding position is fixed or related to the key, so the security is unstable. Numerous senior scholars have proposed adaptive image encryption schemes to prevent the embedding position from affecting the safety of the algorithm [27-31]. Long et al. [27] put forward a dynamic matching algorithm in which an adaptive embedding method on account of image energy is raised, improving the implementation of data storage and distributed management. Yang et al. [30] present a visually cryptographic algorithm in which the original image is encrypted and dynamically embedded into the integer wavelet subbands of the host image. To ensure the complete information content of decrypted images, many scholars have proposed lossless compression encryption methods [32-34]. For instance, Yin et al. [32] used the lossless compression method of Huffman encoding, and Yang et al. [34] employed the SHIFT lossless compression method. Nevertheless, these schemes require high requirements for embedding methods and carrier images.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Motivated by the above analysis, we present a high-quality visual image cryptographic algorithm employing a conservative chaotic system, 2D compressive sensing, and adaptive embedding in this paper. First of all, the encryption algorithm employs a conservative chaotic system that can resist reconstruction attacks. Secondly, the sequences produced by the chaotic system dynamically produce compressive sensing measurement matrices. In addition, new composite DNA computation rules are proposed, and the chaotic sequences dynamically control the encoding and computation of DNA rules to achieve image encryption. Finally, in the hiding stage, the OLBP algorithm is used to process the carrier image, identifying important textured and non-textured areas of the carrier image. By embedding the non-textured regions first and then the textured regions, the damage to the host image is reduced, achieving the goal of image visual security. The detailed contributions of the proposed work are listed as follows:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Stem from the generalized Sprott-A system, a new conservative chaotic system is proposed, which does not exist attractors and can resist reconstruction attacks. Moreover, the produced sequence has strong pseudo randomness, making it advantageous for application in encryption algorithms.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>A new method for optimizing the compressive sensing measurement matrix has been proposed. The sequences produced by the chaotic system dynamically produce compressive sensing measurement matrices and then compress the image.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>The composite DNA computing rules are proposed during the encryption process. The sequences produced by the chaotic system dynamically DNA encode and calculate image information to generate cipher images.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>At the stage of embedding, the newly proposed optimized local binary pattern (OLBP) algorithm processes the host image, separates important textured and non-textured regions of the image by embedding encrypted information into non-textured regions first and then texture regions to reduce damage of the host image, achieving the goal of imperceptible visual security.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the contribution of the works is introduced. Section 3 presents a detailed algorithm description of the proposed visual image encryption. In Section 4, experimental results and analysis are provided. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5.</ce:para>

        <ce:section-title>2.1 Design and analysis of a novel conservative chaotic system</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>(1) Generalized Sprott-A system</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Sprott introduced several simple 3D chaotic systems in 1994, one of which was deeply studied as the Sprott-A system, and its mathematical representation is described as [35]:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>In essence, the Sprott-A system is an exceptional circumstance of the Nosé-Hoover thermostatted oscillator, which has complex, chaotic behavior [36]. Typically, transforming the system into a Kolmogorov system can help analyze the system's dynamic behavior, identify the causes of chaos, and study the impact of energy changes on system dynamics.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Additionally, the Sprott-A system can be described as the Kolmogorov system as follows:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>where</ce:para>
        <ce:para>, , , and .</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Stem from the generalized Sprott-A system, we will introduce a universally applicable method for constructing conservative chaotic systems.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>(2) The conservative chaotic system</ce:para>
        <ce:para>First of all,</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Besides,</ce:para>
        <ce:para>And,</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Let , ,,. Finally, one can get the four dimensional (4D) chaotic system:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>(3) The performance analysis of the proposed system</ce:para>
        <ce:para>For the analysis of chaotic systems, including conservatism analysis, Lyapunov exponent analysis, trajectory analysis, and chaotic sequence analysis. These analyses prove that the system has security advantages in practical applications.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>1) Conservatism analysis</ce:para>
        <ce:para>The chaotic system’s amount of Hamilton energy is</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Furthermore,</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Consequently, we can obtain:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Evidently,</ce:para>
        <ce:para>The Hamilton energy of the 4D chaotic system is always conserved, assuming , the energy of the 4D chaotic system moves on hyperplane K invariably. Assuming a=2, b=3, c=1, d=2, the energy diagram of the system is drew as Figure 1.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Obviously, when the initial values are given, the energy has already been determined as a fixed value, expressing that the system's energy has always been conserved over time.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>In addition, the 4D chaotic system’s divergence is obtained as follows:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>where ,,,.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Furthermore, we can get</ce:para>
        <ce:para>It is noteworthy that the volume of the 4D chaotic system over time is related to . Assuming that the initial volume of the system is , and when , the volume is</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Apparently, the volume of the system is conserved forever.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>2) Lyapunov exponents (LEs) analysis</ce:para>
        <ce:para>When the parameter values , , , , , and initial values x1=8, x2=6, x3=4, x4=2, the LEs chart of the chaotic system is described in Figure 2.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Through the analysis, we can obtain LE1= 24.80, LE2= 0.03, LE3= -0.04, LE4= -24.79. Hence, the system can generate chaotic behavior.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Additionally,</ce:para>
        <ce:para>The sum of all LEs values is 0, demonstrating that the proposed system has conservative characteristics.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>3) Trajectory analysis</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Analyzing the trajectory of a system can observe its motion behavior in phase space. When initial values (2, 4, 2, 4) and (10, 9, 8, 6) are selected respectively, the flow chart of the 4D conservative chaotic system is drew in Figure 3. In addition, The Poincare section diagram of the system is displayed in Figure 4.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Evidently, the chaotic flow chart produced by the system has to do with the given initial value. When different initial values are chosen, the system produces different chaotic flows, which is also the advantage of conservative chaos.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>From Figure 4, it is clear that the system forms a dense and irregular set of points on the plane, manifesting that it is difficult to determine the system’s behavior.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>4) Sequence analysis</ce:para>
        <ce:para>In general, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-22 is employed to test the randomness of the sequence, which consists 15 sub tests. For significance level , the pass rate T is</ce:para>
        <ce:para>where , , s represents dividing into 100 groups. Therefore, if the P-value obtained is within the boundary of and the pass rate T is bigger than 0.9602, denoting that the test has been passed.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>First of all, iterate the 4D conservative chaotic system to produce sequences X1, X2, X3, X4, and then merge them according to the following equation.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Afterwards, perform NIST testing on the chaotic sequence Y. and the Figure 5 displays the P-value and pass rate of Y.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Through sequence analysis, it is obvious that the chaotic sequence passed all 15 NIST sub-tests, manifesting that the randomness of the sequence can be guaranteed and meet the requirements for subsequent encryption use.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>5) Comparative analysis of the performance of different chaotic systems</ce:para>
        <ce:para>We summarize the performance of the proposed conservative hyperchaotic system and compare it with the emerging hyperchaotic systems and conservative chaotic systems in the current field. Table 1 lists the performance comparison among different chaotic systems. The content of comparison and analysis includes the type of chaotic system, whether the volume of the chaotic system is conservative, whether the energy of the chaotic system is conservative, whether the chaotic system has the ability to resist reconstruction attacks, and whether the chaotic system is hyperchaotic.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 1. The performance comparison among different chaotic systems</ce:para>
        <ce:para>As can be seen from Table 1, the proposed system is a Hamiltonian hyperchaotic system with both conservative volume and energy. This system not only has a huge key space, but also has the conservativeness of energy and volume, as well as the ability to resist reconstruction attacks. Compared with the recently proposed hyperchaotic and conservative chaotic systems, the proposed conservative hyperchaotic system exhibits more advantages.</ce:para>

        <ce:section-title>2.2. The compressive sensing algorithm</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>Typically, there is redundancy in signals, and the complexity of signals can be reduced by compressing their information. Compressive sensing (CS) is a new signal compression method recently proposed, which can reconstruct the original signal with fewer sampled signals compared to traditional Nyquist sampling [44].</ce:para>
        <ce:para>For a sparse signal S with a size of  can be measured as [45]:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>where  is an  orthogonal basis, and , which denotes the measurement matrix. Afterwards, transposition of  in the  domain,  can be obtained as:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>where .</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Therefore, the two-dimensional (2D) CS can be defined by another measurement matrix  as:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>where , which denotes another measurement matrix, and , which represents the measurement value matrix.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Supposing that  and  meet the restricted isometry property (RIP), the original signal S may be accurately reconstructed from Z by handling the optimal problem, the detail problem is as follow:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>where denotes the  norm of the vector S.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Recently, multitudinous learned researchers have introduced many excellent methods for signal recovery, such as MP, OMP, SL0, 2DPG-ED, and so on. Among them, 2DPG-ED [46] has more advantages in signal recovery, so this paper chooses this method for signal recovery.</ce:para>

      <ce:section>
        <ce:section-title>2.3 The optimization local binary pattern algorithm</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>The local binary pattern (LBP) is a texture description operator with the advantages of rotation invariance and grayscale invariance, first proposed by Ojala et al. in 1996 [47]. This algorithm displays the texture features of a particular part by describing the pixel relationship between the pixel in that position and its surrounding eight adjacent neighborhoods.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>To maximize the display of the most essential texture in the image, we propose an optimized local binary pattern (OLBP) algorithm based on the traditional LBP algorithm. This method gives priority to embedding pixel positions that are not essential textures, followed by embedding the positions of texture pixels. On the one hand, this can expand the capacity of subsequent pixel embeddings. On the other hand, it minimizes the impact on the carrier image to the greatest extent possible. The operation process of the OLBP algorithm is described in Figure 6. The specific steps are as follows:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Step 1. Select a pixel block of size in the image, where the intermediate pixel value is  and the surrounding pixels are .</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Step 2. Calculate the threshold .</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Step 3. Modify the pixel values around position . .</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Step 4. If the modified  value is less than the , its pixel value is installed to 0; if not, it is installed to 1.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Step 5. Combine the obtained values in a clockwise direction into an 8-bit binary number and convert it to a decimal value as the final pixel value.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Step 6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 for all values of the image pixel to obtain the OLBP processed matrix.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Figure 7 shows the OLBP operation of the Butfish image.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>The OLBP algorithm selects important texture regions of the Butfish image, and non-texture regions are labeled as black areas. When performing information hiding, the adaptive information hiding algorithm can significantly improve the capacity of the carrier image and reduce damage to the carrier image by first embedding non-textured regions and then embedding textured regions.</ce:para>

        <ce:section-title>2.4 The composite DNA computing algorithm</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>Typically, DNA sequences are composed of four bases, embodying adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), where C and G, A and T are complementary. Each image pixel value is transformed into an 8-bit binary, and an 8-bit binary sequence can be converted into a DNA sequence. The encoding rules are shown in Table 2. After encoding, DNA calculations can be performed to reach the aim of encryption. For example, if the pixel value is 228, it is converted to binary as (11100100)2 and encoded on the basis of Rule 1 in Table 2, and it can be represented as TGCA.</ce:para>

        <ce:para>(2) The traditional computing methods</ce:para>
        <ce:para>The traditional computing methods for DNA typically include three types: addition, subtraction, and XOR. Table 3 shows the DNA sequence addition rulers.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 3. Addition rulers</ce:para>

        <ce:para>In order to further enrich the computing rules of DNA sequences, we will introduce the newly designed composite computing rules later.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>(3) New composite DNA computing methods</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Based on traditional calculation methods, we have designed new composite DNA computing methods, but these computing methods need to meet the following rules:</ce:para>
        <ce:para>The rules require that the value of the element remains unchanged every four rounds or multiples of 4. Otherwise, the element will change. Figure 8 illustrates three newly designed DNA computing rules.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Among them, the Add~ rules of DNA sequences are depicted in Table 6.</ce:para>

        <ce:para>Consequently, the proposed decryption algorithm mainly consists of two stages: the first stage is the adaptive extraction and decryption of the image.

In addition, the initial key [x1(0), x2(0), x3(0), x4(0)] is set to [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], and the parameter value [a, b, c, d, k] is set to [2, 1, 2, 1, 3], and the compression ratio CR = 0.5, d = 25.</ce:para>

        <ce:section-title>4.1 Encryption and decryption test</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>Simulation experiments are operated to check the proposed visual image cryptographic algorithm. Foremost, we have selected multiple images to perform in ChestX-ray14 database, USC-SIPI database, CVG-URG database, etc. This includes various scene images, as well as various sizes, grayscale, and color images, and the test results are displayed in Figure 12.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>From Figure 12, it is obvious that the algorithm can achieve the aim of encryption and decryption for both grayscale and color images, as well as medical and human images, etc. Moreover, the host image embedded with encrypted information cannot be distinguished from the plain image, and the decrypted and decompressed image cannot be distinguished from the plain image, thus achieving visual security.</ce:para>
      </ce:section>
      <ce:section>
        <ce:section-title>4.2 The quality analysis of the construction and embedding</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>Additionally, in order to objectively and fairly evaluate the quality of the simulation results, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) are usually employed to estimate the quality of ciphertext images and reconstructed images. The detailed formulas are described in [20].</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Consequently, Table 9 lists the PSNR and MSSIM values between the reconstructed image and the original image, as well as the host image and the steganographic image.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 9. The result of the PSNR and MSSIM values</ce:para>
        <ce:para>According to Table 9, the PSNR of the carrier image and the steganographic image are about 52.8970, and the MSSIM is about 0.9972, manifesting that these two images are approximately the same, and the embedding of encrypted information has little impact on the host image. Additionally, the PSNR of the original image and the reconstructed image is about 38.0998, and the MSSIM is about 0.9637, indicating that the decompressed image is almost identical to the original image. This all implies that the algorithm we designed exists outstanding compression and hiding effects.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Meanwhile, we tested the decryption performance of the cryptographic algorithm under different CR conditions and the damage to the carrier image. Using Baboon as the carrier image and selecting different images as encryption information, the results are shown in Figure 13. Selecting tipo4_e image as encrypted information and different images as carriers to test, and the results obtained are displayed in Table 10.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 10. The PSNR values of different carrier images (unit: dB)</ce:para>
        <ce:para>It is apparent that when the encrypted image is fixed, and different host images are selected, the algorithm still obtains excellent PSNR values under different CR conditions, showing little impact on the carrier image, indicating that the algorithm has universal adaptability to the host image and can achieve high-quality hiding effects.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>For the comparison reconstructed images quality, we used the PSNR indicator as the main analysis indicator, and the PSNR results are displayed in Table 11, where N manifests that it is not offered in the literature.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 11. The PSNR values of reconstructed images</ce:para>
        <ce:para>It is clearly that the average PSNR of our designed algorithm is about 38.7120, which is much better than that of other algorithms, manifesting that the algorithm has excellent compression encryption and reconstruction effects.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>For the steganographic image quality, we still employed PSNR and MISSM indicators as the primary analysis indicators, and the PSNR results are displayed in Table 12.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 12. The PSNR values of steganographic images</ce:para>
        <ce:para>We can find that the mean PSNR of the steganographic image is 52.8972, which is much better than other algorithms. In addition, the MSSIM results are shown in Table 13.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>The 13. The MSSIM values of steganographic images of different algorithms</ce:para>
        <ce:para>From Table 13, we can obtain that the mean SSIM of the steganographic image is about 0.9979, which is also much better than other algorithms. These all manifests that the proposed adaptive embedding algorithm has very little damage to the image of the carrier and meets the requirements of high-quality embedding algorithms.</ce:para>

The key proposed for the algorithm contains the initial value of the system, with each step size of , obtaining a key space of . On the other hand, the key is the 512-bit hash value of the image, so the key space size is . Consequently, the key space of the algorithm is about . Moreover, the key space for the recently proposed cryptographic algorithm is shown in Table 14.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 14. The key space of recently cryptographic algorithms</ce:para>

        <ce:para>The histogram of image information can display the distribution of image pixels. In this section, when the CR is 0.5, we calculate the histograms of the original image and the cipher image, as well as the host and steganographic images. Figure 14 and 15 respectively describe their corresponding test results.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>From Figure 14, it is clear that the proposed algorithm's pixel histogram of the encrypted image is evenly distributed and can hide the pixel information of the plaintext image.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Similarly, from Figure 15, we can conclude that the host image is similar to the steganographic image and difficult to distinguish with the naked eye. The pixel distribution histogram is also roughly the same, indicating that the proposed algorithm has little impact on the carrier's image and can better achieve visual security.</ce:para>

        <ce:section-title>4.5 Information entropy analysis</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>Information entropy (IE) is one of the important indicators for analyzing the resistance of encryption algorithms to statistical attacks. Greater information entropy declares a higher degree of information uncertainty in digital images. The mathematical expression of the IE is defined in [53].</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Equally, when the CR is 0.5, we selected multiple images in the database for experiments, and the corresponding test results are displayed in Figure 16.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>From Figure 16, It is evident that although the information content of the compressed image is significantly reduced, and even some plain images have an information entropy of around 1, the information entropy of the encrypted image has always been about 8, demonstrating that the algorithm has an excellent capability to hide plaintext information.</ce:para>

      <ce:section>
        <ce:section-title>4.6 Correlation coefficient analysis</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>The neighboring pixels in the original image exhibit significant correlation, in which attackers may obtain information about the plaintext. Mastering this information is likely to break through encryption algorithms. Therefore, outstanding encryption algorithms can reduce these correlations, and correlation coefficients (CC) are one way to test this relationship. The detailed formula is described in reference [54].</ce:para>
        <ce:para>We randomly selected multiple pairs of pixels in the Frog plain and cipher image and tested their CCs in various directions, such as horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. The corresponding results are described in Figure 17. The results of selecting multiple images and their corresponding correlation coefficients are displayed in Figure 18.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>We can clearly find that the color Frog plain image has a strong correlation and has significantly reduced their correlation after encryption by the algorithm, demonstrating the strong ability of the algorithm to hide ciphertext information.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>From Figure 18, it can be seen that the encryption algorithm has universality for images. Regardless of the amount of information in the image, the encryption algorithm we present can effectively reduce the correlation of image information and protect it well.</ce:para>

        <ce:section-title>4.7 Plaintext sensitivity analysis</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>Plaintext sensitivity aims to analyze the sensitivity of algorithms to plaintext. When the plaintext image information changes slightly, outstanding algorithms are more sensitive, and the generated ciphertext will cause significant changes. Conversely, it indicates that the algorithm is not sensitive to the plaintext information of the image. The number of pixels changing rate (NPCR)and the unified average changed intensity (UACI) can be used as indicators for detecting the sensitivity of algorithms to plaintext information, and the detailed formulas are defined in [28]</ce:para>
        <ce:para>After slightly changing the value of a pixel position on different plain images, the NPCR and UACI calculated for the ciphertext image and the original ciphertext image are displayed in Table 15.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 15. The NPCR and UACI values of two times cipher image (unit: %)</ce:para>
        <ce:para>We can obtain an average value of 99.6097% for NPCR and 33.4323% for UACI, close to their theoretical values of 99.6094% and 33.4635%, respectively. This manifests that the algorithm is very sensitive to ordinary image information.</ce:para>

      </ce:section>
      <ce:section>
        <ce:section-title>4.8.1 Cropping attack</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>In this section, when the CR is 0.5, we select Female, House, and Lena images as encrypted images and Elephant, Earth, and Butfish as steganographic images. The decryption results obtained in the simulated channel with different amounts of information loss in steganographic images are displayed in Figure 19, and the PSNR values are described in Figure 20.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>The decrypted image can still be obtained even if the steganographic image information is lost in the channel. Even though 50% of the data is lost in the steganographic image, the decrypted image can still be clearly seen, indicating that the algorithm can resist information loss attacks in the channel.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>We can observe that the algorithm can still obtain decrypted images and PSNR values exceeding 30 dB for cropping attacks with varying intensities. The algorithm can stand cropping attacks in the channel well.</ce:para>
      </ce:section>
      <ce:section>
        <ce:section-title>4.8.2 Noise attack</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>Similarly, when the CR is 0.5, we select Female, House, and Lena images as encrypted images and Elephant, Earth, and Butfish as steganographic images. The decryption results obtained by adding different salt and pepper noise (SPN) intensities to the steganographic image are described in Figure 21, and the PSNR values are drew in Figure 22.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>It is evidently observed that the algorithm can still decrypt the corresponding decrypted images for SPNs with different intensities in the channel, and even with the addition of 10% intensity, the corresponding decrypted images can still be obtained. This further implies that the proposed algorithm has sufficient robustness.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Moreover, from Figure 22, we can find that for SPN attacks with varying intensities, the proposed algorithm can still obtain decrypted images and excellent PSNR values, showing the algorithm's robustness.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>For the robustness comparison analysis, the PSNR indicator is also chosen to analyze the robustness of different algorithms, and the PSNR results of data loss are displayed in Table 16.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 16. The PSNR values of data loss attacks</ce:para>
        <ce:para>By simulating information loss of different sizes, the algorithm can still obtain larger PSNR values, and the impact of lost information on the algorithm is small. The PSNR values of SPN attacks are displayed in Table 17.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 17. The PSNR values of SPN attacks</ce:para>
        <ce:para>From Tables 16 and 17, We can obtain that whether it is a cropping attack with varying intensities or an SPN attack, the calculated PSNR values are all superior to other encryption algorithms, further proving the proposed algorithm's high-quality robustness.</ce:para>

        <ce:section-title>4.9 Efficiency analysis</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>An outstanding encryption algorithm not only needs to have security guarantees but also needs efficiency. Therefore, we selected images of different sizes as encrypted information to calculate the corresponding consumption time of the encryption process, as displayed in Table 18.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 18. Running time for encryption process (unit: s)</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Consequently, the compression, encryption, and hiding processes of encryption algorithms can be achieved in a very short amount of time. Moreover, the consumption time of the decryption process is displayed in Table 19.</ce:para>
        <ce:para>Table 19. Running time for decryption process (unit: s)</ce:para>
        <ce:para>According to Tables 18 and 19, the primary time consumption of the algorithm is in the reconstruction process, accounting for more than 50% of the total time consumption. Overall, the algorithm is still relatively efficient in each stage and can quickly complete the encryption purpose.</ce:para>
      </ce:section>
      <ce:section>
        <ce:section-title>5. Conclusions</ce:section-title>
        <ce:para>To ensure the confidentiality of images in the transmission channel, a high-quality, visual image encryption algorithm based on a conservative chaotic system and adaptive embedding is put forward. Firstly, a high-performance conservative chaotic system capable of resisting reconstruction attack is proposed. Secondly, in the encryption and compression stage, 2D compression sensing is used, and a conservative chaotic system dynamically generates measurement matrices for 2D compression sensing and compresses the images. In the encryption stage, new composite DNA computing rules are designed, combined with the sequences produced by the chaotic system, to dynamically encrypt the image. Finally, in the embedding stage, the OLBP algorithm, which can annotate the important texture features of the host image to the greatest extent, is proposed. The encrypted information is first embedded in unimportant non-textured regions and then embedded in texture regions. On the one hand, it can increase the amount of embedded data; on the other hand, it can reduce the damage to the host image information. Experimental simulation and testing imply that the algorithm has excellent encryption, compression, and embedding effects and is a high-quality visual image cryptographic algorithm with practical application value.</ce:para>
